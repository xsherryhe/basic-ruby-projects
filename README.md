These files are a collection of basic functions and programs built from the Ruby language.

The collection demonstrates basic Ruby syntax, including data types, loops, arrays, and methods.

Included in the collection:
1. caesar_cipher.rb - A simple Caesar cipher that takes in a string and shift factor, and returns the Caesar encryption.
2. substrings.rb - A method that takes a string and a "dictionary" array of substrings, and returns a hash with a tally of how many times each substring was found.
